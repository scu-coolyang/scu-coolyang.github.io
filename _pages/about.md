I’m an associate professor at College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, focusing on Biologically Inspired Computer Vision (BICV). I was previously working on computer vision techniques for color constancy and visual adaptation, and earned my PhD from UESTC in 2017. During 2015–2016, I was an visiting student at UCL Visual Neuroscience Laboratory.


Research Interest
======

- **Biologically Inspired Computational Vision:** Color Constancy


- **Image Processing:** Early Visual Infromation Processing and It's Applications


- **Medecial Image Processing**
